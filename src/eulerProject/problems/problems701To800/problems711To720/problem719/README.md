# Problem 719

We define an $$S$$-number to be a natural number, $$n$$, that is perfect square and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of $$n$$ into 2 or more numbers then adding the numbers.

For example, 81 is an $$S$$-number because $$\sqrt{81} = 8+1$$.
6724 is an $$S$$-number: $$\sqrt{6724} = 6+72+4$$.
8281 is an $$S$$-number: $$\sqrt{8281} = 8+2+81$$ = 82 + 8 + 1.
9801 is an $$S$$-number: $$\sqrt{9801} = 98+0+1$$.

Further we define $$T\(N\)$$ to be the sum of all $$S$$ numbers $$n \ge N$$. You are given $$T\(10^4\)=41333$$.
Find $$T\(10^{12}\)$$.
